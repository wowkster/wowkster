Hey! I'm Adrian, and I'm an experienced all-around developer with a focus in Web Development. I've been programming for over 9 years, and have been working professionally for over 4 years now. In that time, I have acquired experience with a large amount of languages and technologies like Java, Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Tailwind, React, NextJS, Vue, JQuery, PHP, Express, Fastify, SQL, MongoDB, Python, C++, C#, Rust, x86 assembly, and more.

## Contact
You can contact me on Discord (preferred) at `@wowkster` or by email at `contact@adrianwowk.com`. I take commissions if you like my work. If you are contacting me about an issue with a project, please open a GitHub issue on that repository instead. I will tend to it as soon as I can.

    * FAT12 file system driver
    * Stage 2 loader
    * Error tolerant design with error messages
    * All fits into 512 byte boot sector (448 bytes when you subtract space occupied by BPB)
  * Stage 2 bootloader written in x86 assembly
    * Kernel loader
    * GDT initializer
    * 32-bit protected mode initializer
  * Kernel written in x86 assembly (for now)
    * VGA text mode drivers
    * PIC programming
    * IDT setup
    * Interrupt handling
    * Memory Paging
    * PS/2 Keyboard Drivers
