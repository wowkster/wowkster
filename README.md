## Resume

I have been developing for many years and have a decent amount of experience with many different languages, technologies, and frameworks. Below I have outlined some projects that I have worked on and the skills I demonstrated there.

### Cloaks+

[Cloaks+](https://github.com/CloaksPlus) is a Minecraft addon that allows you to get free Capes and Cosmetics on any Minecraft Client. We use:

* Vite with SCSS for our main website which I helped create
* React with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for our new website which I did completely myself(coming soon)
* Typescript/Discord.js for our Discord bot which I originally authored
* Typescript/Fastify/Mongo for our backend API which I wrote myself
* Java/Kotlin for various Minecraft Plugins which i wrote may of
* C# for our Desktop app which i wrote a decent amount of
* C++ for our upcoming update for more client support
* Typescript/Socket.io/Vue for a website which renders cape textures using Blender
* Python for said cape render script
* JS for a [Blockbench](https://blockbench.net) plugin (coming soon)

### Komodo

[Komodo](https://github.com/KomodoLang/Komodo) is a compiled general-purpose programming language I am working on which is inspired by Javascript. I originally began development with C++, but decided that it was more work than I would have wanted, so I elected to use Typescript instead.

### American Sniper

[The American Sniper](https://github.com/wowkster/AmericanSniper) is a RTX GPU sniping bot I am working on written in Typescript

### Spigot

I have a decent amount of experience with the Spigot/Bukkit API for creating Minecraft server plugins. For a while I did freelance work on Fiverr. You can check out some of my plugins on [My SpigotMC page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/wowkster.946669/) although they are mostly outdated.

### Minecraft Mods

I have created several Minecraft mods for both Fabric and Forge, as well as a custom Minecraft client. I have worked with several Youtubers to create custom mods for videos and streams.

### More

Naturally as any other developer I have countless other small side projects I like to work on including a Discord email client, various automation apps, etc.

## Goals and Aspirations

In the coming year 2022 I hope to expand my horizons even further and learn some of the following:

* Flutter
* React Native
* Swift
* Go
* Rust
* Haskell
* Redux
* Elixir
* Angular
* Laravel
* Assembly
