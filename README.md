Hey! I'm Wowkster, and I'm an experienced all-around developer with a focus in Web Development. I've been programming for over 9 years, and have been working professionally for over 3 years now. In that time, I have acquired experience with a large amount of languages and technologies like Java, Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Tailwind, React, NextJS, Vue, JQuery, PHP, Express, Fastify, SQL, MongoDB, Python, C++, C#, Rust, and more. See the [Resume](#resume) section for more info.

## Resume

I have been developing for many years and have a decent amount of experience with many different languages, technologies, and frameworks. Below I have outlined some projects that I have worked on and the skills I demonstrated there.

### Cloaks+

[Cloaks+](https://github.com/CloaksPlus) is a Minecraft addon that allows you to get free Capes and Cosmetics on any Minecraft Client. We use:

* NextJS, Typescript, and styled-components for our website
* Typescript/Discord.js for our Discord bot
* Typescript/Fastify/Mongo as well as some rust compoents for our backend API
* Java/Kotlin for various Minecraft Plugins
* C# for our Desktop App
* Typescript/Socket.io/Vue for a website which renders cape textures using Blender
* Python for said cape render script
* ThreeJS/Typescript for renderer-rewrite

### Spigot

I have a decent amount of experience with the Spigot/Bukkit API for creating Minecraft server plugins. For a while I did freelance work on Fiverr. You can check out some of my plugins on [My SpigotMC page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authors/wowkster.946669/) although they are mostly outdated.

### Minecraft Mods

I have created several Minecraft mods for both Fabric and Forge, as well as a custom Minecraft client. I have worked with several Youtubers to create custom mods for videos and streams.

### More

Naturally as any other developer I have countless other small side projects I like to work on including a Discord email client, various automation apps, etc.
