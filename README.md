Hey! My name is Adrian, and I'm a well-rounded software engineer with over 10 years of programming experience. I've been working professionally for the last 5 years and in that time I've worked with a large amount of languages like Rust, C/C++, Java, Javascript/Typescript, PHP, Python, Kotlin, Swift, C#, x86 assembly, and more. I also have experience with an ever-increasing number of related technologies including React/NextJS, Vue/Nuxt, Tailwind, HTMX, Axum, Express, Fastify, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, Kubernetes, and Git just to name a few.

Over the years I've had the opportunity to explore many different fields such as web development, mobile development, systems programming, embedded firmware development, game/graphics programming, compiler engineering, operating system development, and many others. Currently I'm employed full-time at [Adom Industries Inc.](https://github.com/adom-inc) where I work all across the software (and hardware) stack tackling exciting problems in robotics and distributed systems.

    * Stage 2 loader
    * Error tolerant design with error messages
    * All fits into 512 byte boot sector (448 bytes when you subtract space occupied by BPB)
  * Stage 2 bootloader written in x86 assembly
    * Kernel loader
    * GDT initializer
    * 32-bit protected mode initializer
  * Kernel written in x86 assembly (for now)
